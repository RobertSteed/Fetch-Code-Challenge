# Fetch-Code-Challenge
This is the code challenge offered to me by the company Fetch
I called the API that was given to me and displayed the information into a list. 
I was instructed to add ingredients to the list, but when I looked at the JSON there were no ingredients to be called down. So I created a space for them to be included, but I cannot fill the space because there is nothing to call.
I broke up my files the best I could. Some are tiny, others are larger. The names should be sufficient enough to understand what they are.
